# Rule: Use shadcn as the Design Library

**Rule:**
All UI components and styling in this project must use the shadcn design system and its component library as the primary source of design patterns, components, and visual language.

**Rationale:**

- Ensures a unified, modern, and accessible user interface
- Promotes consistency in component usage, spacing, and theming
- Simplifies maintenance and onboarding for new contributors

**Guidelines:**

- Use shadcn UI components (e.g., Button, Card, Input, Dialog, Badge, etc.) for all new UI features and when refactoring existing UI
- Avoid custom CSS or third-party component libraries unless a shadcn component does not exist for the use case
- Follow shadcn documentation and best practices for component composition and theming
- When extending or customizing components, do so by extending shadcn primitives and patterns

**Exceptions:**

- Only use custom or third-party components if shadcn does not provide a suitable alternative and the use case is justified in code comments
